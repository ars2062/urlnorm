urlnorm.py - Normalize URLs
Copyright (C) 2010 Kurt McKee <contactme@kurtmckee.org>

The primary goal of urlnorm.py is to normalize URLs so that,
given two functionally identical URLs, such as
    http://example.test:80
    http://EXAMPLE.TEST/
both will be reduced to this more canonical form:
    http://example.test/

The secondary goal of urlnorm.py is to provide a basic way
to anonymize or "fix" URLs with additional or unnecessary
crud attached. For instance, it would ideally be possible
to modify urlnorm.py to strip out query variables that
complicate the URL, such as those added by Feedburner:
    ...?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign...

This is not release-quality software by a long shot.
